Steven Liu,"Problem solver, culture explorer, lifelong learner. Before joining Jarvis, I graduated from the University of Saskatchewan with an Honors B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Statistics. The blend of academic training has given me both solid coding and analytical skills. I found my interest in data engineering in my final year of university, which is a discipline that includes all the exciting things I am passionate about. I look forward to opportunities to utilize and develop my skills from Jarvis' clients in Toronto.

Artem Anosov,"I am a recent graduate from the University of Manitoba where I majored in Computer Science. Throughout my studies, I enjoyed learning software development and databases most. As for programming languages, Java is my favorite which is what I used in most assignments and projects, due to its OOP nature. Although I love learning, I also love implementing it. As a result, I was involved in different group projects in school, the biggest one was developing the website in a group of four people. It was very interesting and provided me with tons of valuable knowledge. During this phase of my life, I also learned more about my hobbies which include going to the gym, traveling, playing soccer, ping pong, and pool. Outside of my academic responsibilities, I also worked as a grocery/drugstore stock associate and a cashier at London Drugs. This opportunity, allowed me to improve my communicational and multitasking skills. In addition to that, it also taught me the importance of finding a work-life balance that I am now able to skillfully employ in my role and experiences here at Jarvis.

David Yang,"I am a graduate from the University of Toronto with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Professionally, I have had the opportunity to take on a few months of software work experience writing perl, python & tcl scripts to automate and report data in human readable tables and graphs. With automation, I was able to cut time spent on analyzing data by more than half. In addition to work experience, I enjoyed topics related to big data in school - my favorites being deep learning and databases. Outside of work I enjoy playing badminton and simulation video games. One game I enjoy in particular is City Skylines as I enjoy creating custom maps as well as testing other people's mods and others via Steam workshop. This hobby has instilled in me an appreciation for developers who provide good documentation for others to understand how to apply their work.

Mathew Vassair,"I graduated from a joint program between Brock University and Sheridan College, Computing and Network Communications. This program covered programming theory, practical applications, computer networking concepts and applications, and systems design. Between my education and my varied co-op experiences, I have built up a wide knowledge base and learned how to quickly teach myself new concepts, which I believe makes me a perfect fit for the Data Engineering industry. I'm also interested in the potential crossover between Data Engineering and other fields, both inside and outside the IT sphere, since a little external domain knowledge can go a long way in creating new solutions. Outside of Data Engineering, I enjoy photography, hiking, playing online games, and video game speedrunning.

Zongpeng Yang,"I recently graduated from Queen's University with a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Science in Engineering Physics. I chose to move halfway across the globe from China to Kingston, Ontario to pursue a career in engineering. During the last year of University, I found my interest in Computer Science which is when I decided to enroll in basic CS courses and eventually found myself pursuing a second degree in computer science. I am passionate about learning new technology software as well as applying new and developed skillsets. Additionally, I also love to partake in competitive video games with friends all over the country. In totality, I am excited to pursue a career in data engineering to further develop my skills and hone in on that which I am passionate about.

Noshin Sadat,"I have recently graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Master of Mathematics in Computer Science and I am looking to get my feet wet in the Data Engineering industry. I have a natural affinity for problem-solving. This developed into a genuine interest in pursuing a career in Computer Science and led me to pursue both an undergraduate and a graduate degree in this field. I got particularly interested in working with data and did several projects related to the same. I have gained strong programming skills in Java and R while working on assignments and projects. I also worked as Lecturer for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Introduction to Programming courses where the main language in practice was Java. This has helped me to develop a strong understanding of the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. During my downtime, I like reading, listening to music, hanging out with friends and family, and sight-seeing. My career goal is to be able to solve real-world problems with the knowledge and experiences I gain.
